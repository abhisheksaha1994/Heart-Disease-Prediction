# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a range of clinical and demographic features. The dataset used includes attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and electrocardiogram results, among others.
## Dataset

## Project Highlights
## Objective:

- Predict whether a patient has heart disease (1) or not (0).
- Provide insights into which features contribute most to heart disease prediction.

## Tech Stack:

## Programming Language: - Python
## Libraries:
- Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation and preprocessing)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Imbalanced-learn (Machine Learning and Model Tuning)
- Pandas Profiling (Data profiling and EDA)

## Models Implemented:
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

## Key Techniques:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations and statistical methods.
- Preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- Balancing the dataset with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
- Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV for optimized model performance.

## Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score

## Results:
- Comprehensive comparison of the models in terms of performance on both training and testing datasets.
- XGBoost showed the highest performance due to its gradient boosting mechanism.
